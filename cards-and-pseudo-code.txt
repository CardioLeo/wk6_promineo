menu() {
	Class Deck {
		Class Card {
			. . .;
		}	
	}
	Class Player {
		Class Hand {
			inherits Class card?;
			cards stored in Hand array;
		}
	}
	steps: {
		-fill out deck with (cards x13) x (suites x4), [points?]
		-instantiate 2 player objects and deck
		-shuffle deck
		-loop through shuffled deck, dealing every card to each player, alternating back and forth
		-when both players have full 26 cards, begin play
			--play involves each player playing top card (1, add played card to player score, 2, use .pop() to take that off the top of the array?)
			--when all cards are dealt, played, and scores added up; scores must be compared; winningScore > losingScore, || if score1 === score2, game is tied.
