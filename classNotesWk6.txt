"Rubber-Ducking"

Rubber duck debugging.

talking about it to become more comfortable.

very cool stuff;

a web application version of the Week 6 version?

Sara Kuenzi is sharing her coding projects; haha, it's in really good shape for both weeks! cest la vie

I have got to find out how to devote more time to this.

I should check out Kuenzi's github for Week 5.

good to know that Kuenzi also followed the video; when asked if she plotted it out beforehand.

I should plot more out about that project. I really need to figure it out.

dan Wilson, made second menu also a while loop. // good idea

Pat W, asking how to use filter instead of splice (Sara used splice, he said).

Stepanski showing us an example from week 4; this is his example but with id key-value pairs added.

let parks = [
	{ id: 1, name: "sd", rating: 4.2 }, // 4 items
	{ id: 2, name: "hs", rating: 5 },
	{ id: 3, name: "lw", rating: 4.5 },
	{ id: 4, name: "js", rating: 4.1 },
];

// let result = parks.filter((park) => park.rating >= 4.5); // original example

let result = partks.filter((park) => park.name != "sd"); // tonights new code

console.log(result);

showing us the miro.com/ application for mapping coding thought. pretty cool. I made an account.

A pattern for engineering.

menu --> methods

^

TaskList --> methods, and perhaps properties

^

task --> only properties

pattern for engineering:

"The Single Responsibility Principle" (principle? pattern?)
