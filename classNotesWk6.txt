"Rubber-Ducking"

Rubber duck debugging.

talking about it to become more comfortable.

very cool stuff;

a web application version of the Week 6 version?

Sara Kuenzi is sharing her coding projects; haha, it's in really good shape for both weeks! cest la vie

I have got to find out how to devote more time to this.

I should check out Kuenzi's github for Week 5.

good to know that Kuenzi also followed the video; when asked if she plotted it out beforehand.

I should plot more out about that project. I really need to figure it out.
